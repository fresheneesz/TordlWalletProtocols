# Tordl Wallet Protocols

**Version:** 0.4.1, **Status:** *Ready for Review*

The Tordl Wallet protocols are step-by-step guides for storing bitcoins in a secure self-managed be-your-own-bank way. There are a number of methods, each with their own trade offs. Some of the methods are able to securely store large amounts of money ($100,000+) for the long term. Following these protocols can give you the peace of mind that your funds are safe and can be accessed relatively easily when needed.

Security is something that should be done using well vetted methods, rather than rolling your own. Storing bitcoin can be error-prone and cumbersome for even tech savvy bitcoiners. The Tordl Wallet Protocols are intended to become a (hopefully well-vetted) standard anyone can use to safely and securely store and use their bitcoin.

This repository contains a number of open-source methods for backing up and storing bitcoin. These methods are built modularly out of sub-methods that can then be mixed and matched and are designed so many different products and services can refer to them as part of derived methods that are more specific to a particular product.

Note that the ratings for Loss Redundancy, Compromise Resilience, Security, etc are defined in the [Properties Key](misc/propertiesKey.md).

## Using Tordl

To use the Tordl Wallet Protocols, follow the instructions at [Obtaining Tordl](misc/obtaining-tordl.md).

## Holistic Wallet Protocols

These are holistic protocols that, when followed completely, are intended to allow coins to be used safely, secure from theft, and resilient to loss or damage. **This is where you should start from; choose a single wallet or a tiered wallet**.

### Single Wallets

Each protocol in this section defines a protocol for setting up a single wallet and defines its properties. These can be thought of as a single "account".

* [Basic Wallet](singleWalletProtocols/Basic-Hot-Wallet.md)
  * Good for small amounts (**< $500**).
  * Loss Redundancy: **inaccessible**/**none**, Compromise Resilience: **brute-force**/**single**.
  * Note: This protocol does not protect against memory loss or death.
  * Requires at least 1 storage location.
* [2-of-3 Multisig Wallet Protocol](singleWalletProtocols/2-of-3-Wallet.md)
  * Good for medium amounts (**< $20,000**).
  * Loss Redundancy: **none**/**single**, Compromise Resilience: **single**/**double**.
  * Requires at least 2 storage locations.
* [Redundancy-focused 3-of-5 Multisig Wallet Protocol](singleWalletProtocols/3-of-5-Redundancy-focused-Wallet.md)
  * Good for large amounts (**> $20,000**).
  * Loss Redundancy: **single**/**double**, Compromise Resilience: **single**/**double**.
  * Requires at least 3 storage locations.
* [Security-focused 3-of-5 Multisig Wallet Protocol](singleWalletProtocols/3-of-5-Security-focused-Wallet.md)
  * Good for large amounts (**> $20,000**).
  * Loss Redundancy: **none**/**single**, Compromise Resilience: **double**/**triple**.
  * Resilient to the [$5 wrench attack](https://xkcd.com/538/).
  * Requires at least 3 storage locations.

### Tiered Wallets

These multi-wallet setups are made to maximize both security and convenience by using convenience-wallets to store small amounts for frequent transactions and more secure but less-frequently-used wallets to store large amounts.

* [Two-Tiered Wallet](multiWalletProtocols/Simple-2-Tier-Wallet.md)
<!--* [Three-Tiered Wallet](multiWalletProtocols/Simple-3-Tier-Wallet.md)-->

## Wallet Methods

These are methods describing the creation and use of a type of wallet. Each of these protocols document 5 major actions a good wallet needs to perform: creation, receiving, sending, maintenance, and recovery.

* [Basic Wallet Protocol](singleWalletProtocols/Basic-Wallet-Protocol.md)
* [Simple-Multisig Wallet Protocol](singleWalletProtocols/Simple-Multisig-Wallet-Protocol.md)
* [3-of-5 Multisig Wallet Protocol](singleWalletProtocols/3-of-5-Wallet.md)
* [Decoy Wallet](singleWalletProtocols/Decoy-Wallet.md)

## Wallet Host Devices

These are methods that can hold a wallet containing a single seed, and can serve as a single wallet or a piece of a multi-signature wallet.

* [Hardware wallet](walletHostDevices/Hardware-Wallet.md). Cost: **~$60**, Security: **7/10**, Effort: **3/10**
* [Mobile wallet](walletHostDevices/Mobile-Wallet.md). Cost: **~$0**, Security: **3/10**, Effort: **1/10**

## Seed Backup Methods

These methods are for backing up a seed (which should usually be passphrase-protected).

* [Metal Backup](backupMethods/Stamped-Metal-Seed-Backup.md). Cost: **~$35**, Durability: **10/10**, Effort: **6/10**
* [Secured Paper Backup](backupMethods/Secured-Paper-Seed-Backup.md). Cost: **~$0**, Durability: **5/10**, Effort: **3/10**

## Storage Locations

* [Home Safe](storageLocations/Home-Safe.md). Cost: **~$30**, Security: **5/10**, Durability: **7/10**, Effort: **3/10**
* [Safe Deposit Box](storageLocations/Safe-Deposit-Box.md). Cost: **~$30**, Security: **5/10**, Durability: **5/10**, Effort: **7/10**
* [On your person](storageLocations/On-Your-Person.md). Cost: **$0**, Security: **3/10**, Durability: **3/10**, Effort: **variable**

## Passphrase Methods

These methods are protocols for creation of memorable passphrases that satisfy the "something you know" in the [three factors of authentication](http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1718488). These methods are intended to contain the steps to create a strong password, keep it secure once you have created it, and ensure it is remembered.

* [Offline Master Passphrase](passphraseMethods/Offline-Master-Passphrase.md). Security: **10/10**, Effort: **5/10**
* [Basic Master Passphrase](passphraseMethods/Basic-Master-Passphrase.md). Security: **5/10**, Effort: **3/10**
* [Non-master Password](passphraseMethods/Non-master-Password.md). Security: **3/10**, Effort: **2/10**
* [Non-critical Password](passphraseMethods/Non-critical-Password.md). Security: **2/10**, Effort: **2/10**
